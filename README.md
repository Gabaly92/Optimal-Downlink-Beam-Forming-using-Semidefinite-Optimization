# Optimal-Downlink-Beam-Forming-using-Semidefinite-Optimization
What is Beamforming, it is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission. One type of sensor arrays is antenna arrays. When using antenna arrays at the base station of a cellular system, an optimal choice of beam formers for simultaneous transmission to several co channel users must be solved jointly for all users and the base stations in the area while taking into consideration the SINR (Signal to interference plus noise ratio) which is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on the channel capacity or the rate
of information transfer in wireless communication systems.
Problem formulation:
 We consider the following problem, where we want to minimize the total transmitted power from the base stations to the mobile  
 devices under the constraint that the received SINR at each mobile is above a threshold Î³
